This modpack is kinda like SkyBlock, except you don't start with a tree and you're surrounded by stone
ItÂ´s a kitchen-sink modpack with lots of quests to help guide you in the start and to give the players goals to reach

This is not a lightweight pack
Requirements:
The Twitch App to download it
At least 4-6GB of RAM allocated to the pack.
A decent CPU.

Note:
Choose the world type "Void? World" in single-player, or "voidworld" on servers.
If something regarding quests or quests rewards is mentiond in the update log, do "/bq_admin default load" and "/bqs_loot default load" to update your questbook.
